                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Sam. An aspiring programmer/DSP engineer. I made this website to show some of the projects that 
                    I've completed or am currently working on and as a place to document some of my key skills and interests. 
                    I hope to expand the website as I gain experience in my field but for now I have put together a selection 
                    of some of the work I have created over the past few years whilst at University and working at my 
                    placement in Paris. Enjoy!
                </p>

                            <h5>Python</h5>
                            <p>
                                I have around a year's experience working in python and find it's simple syntax perfect for 
                                quickly prototyping ideas and is one of my primary means for developing DSP based programs. 
                                During my time at the IRCAM research institute I used Python extensively on a number of 
                                different tasks to perform audio analysis and synthesis related processes. Though I mainly 
                                worked in Python 2 I am also familiar with Python 3. I am also familiar with packages such as 
                                Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib.
                                Check out some of the projects I have worked on in python here!

                            <h5>Unix</h5>
                            <p>
                                Having worked almost exclusively on Mac and Linux for a number of years I am very familiar with 
                                the Unix environment. I have recently begun to experiment with creating shell scripts to help 
                                automate processes I perform regularly. The best example of my understanding of Unix would be to 
                                check out my source repository here. It demonstrates how I have used shell scripts to automate 
                                the process of setting up a new machine with the environment as I need it.

                        <div id="cplusplus">
                            <h5>C++</h5>
                            <p>
                                I have used C++ to create audio effects using the Steinberg VST framework as part of coursework 
                                for my degree. I have also experimented with creating simple standalone command line tools. 
                                I like the language for it's high performance when compared to python (due to the compiled nature 
                                of the language) though I currently tend to work less in this language as I find it less flexible 
                                for quickly prototyping my ideas. I plan on improving my skills in this language when I feel that 
                                one of my projects has reached a point where it would benefit from being converted to a compiled 
                                language.

                                My editor of choice is Vim and have been using it for around a year. I feel the main advantage is 
                                that it is a widely available editor due to it's age and its exceptional ability to be adaptable 
                                to all different languages through customization. This allows me to develop in the same environment 
                                with modifications to create an IDE style workspace tailored to each task.If you are interested my 
                                Vim configurations can be found here.

                                I recently became interested in coding a website as a side project to improve my skills in an area 
                                that I am much less familiar with. This has resulted in the website you are looking at now! I thought 
                                it would be beneficial to teach myself something not totally unrelated to my aspirations but enough 
                                to give me a different challenge to apply the new skills I have acquired over the past few years to. 
                                As a result I am now familiar with HTML5, CSS and understand the basics of JavaScript (though I feel 
                                this would not be difficult to build upon given my experience in Python).

                        <h4>Music</h4>
                        <p>
                            I have always enjoyed writing and playing music. As a child I was taught the Piano and continue to 
                            practice as a hobby in my spare time. Through studying Music Technology at university I have had the 
                            opportunity to expand on my understanding of Music and how computers and signal processing techniques 
                            can be applied creatively to design and manipulate sounds. I also have a good understanding of music 
                            recording techniques and industry standards for recording instruments in a music studio environment. 
                            Although I hope to progress primarily in a technical industry where logic is key, I feel the slightly 
                            less conventional path I have taken to reach my current position will provide me with a different 
                            perspective on tasks than that of a standard computer science graduate, for example.

                    <p>
                        IRCAM has has been my first experience in a professional working environment. During my time there I gained an 
                        understanding of how teams work togeather to produce professional products and participated in the development 
                        of such products. My ability to write readable and stable code was important when contributing to projects and 
                        my knowlege of Unix, Git, VIM, Python, C++ etc... grew substantially during my time there. I also learnt how to 
                        work on a project alongside other member of the team and due to the wide variety of projects that I was tasked 
                        with improving, my ability to adapt to tasks where I did not have prior experience improved dramatically. An 
                        example of this could be when I was tasked with fixing a reveal.js prsentation. A simple task but in a language 
                        (or 3, HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that I had never used before. I think this ability to adapt to a given 
                        situation is important in a rapidly changing industry.
